        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Elías. I'm from Uruguay, but now I'm living in Chile with my family. <br><br> When I was a child, I used to walk barefoot in places like the one we see in this image. It's beautiful isn't? I can asure you that it's very peaceful. Now I'm living in a city and I miss a lot that life style.</p>

        <h1>I'm a Spanish Teacher</h1>
        <p>I decided to be a teacher due to the lack of educational options and economic limitations in which I lived. It was not my declared vocation. However, with each passing year I found more pleasure in the profession. I spent five years working as a teacher, especially in the rural parts of the region where I lived. That usually happens when you're a novice. The older teachers choose the nearest schools first, and the teachers who come in the rear have to choose to work in the remotest schools.</p>

        <h1>The Web Design and Development Path</h1>

        <p>
            Four years ago I started studying Web Design and Development for two reasons:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                Although I started to like working as a teacher, my future was not very promising economically speaking because teachers are poorly paid in Latin America.
            </li>
            <li>
                I was guided from above to study Computer Science. I can testify that I felt in more than one occasion, how the Lord wanted me to undertake this learning path.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            I remember once I was in the Institute library where I started studying computer science, and when I took a PHP book in my hands, I felt a suddenly strong emotion, which for me, was a confirmation from above that this was an inspired decision.

                This website was the last assignment of the CIT 230 course. To do this site I applied everything I learned during the course. The site is not beautiful, but I did it in one night!

                This website was difficult to do and it took a long time to do it; it contains JSON, AJAX and JavaScript coding, with grid layout in the front-end.

                I enjoyed creating this website. The vw air cooled are my favorite cars. In this site I briefly describe some models and how I became a fan of these wonderful cars.

        <h1>In a not so distant day...</h1>
        <p>Now I know why the Lord wanted me to study code. Two years ago, the pathway program emerged offering a door to enter at BYU-I Online. Now I am studying hard to achieve my Associate, and if everything goes well, in about two years I would achieve my Bachelor degree. There is a good chance that there will be stumbles along the way, but I do not care. My goal is to graduate in the fall semester of 2020.</p>
